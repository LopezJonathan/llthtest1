    <h1>Geolocation Test Menu Page</h1>
    <p>This is a really quick geolocation menu page I made so you could see some of the different Geolocation pages I was working on and researching.</p>
    <p>Currently the second test I worked on involving a third map is not functional probably due to an invalide token. So for now there are only two options.</p>
    <p>The second choice uses ArcGIS maps, where as the first uses a static image from google maps. However the first gets an image of where your are geographically.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="TestGeolocation.html">Geolocation Test 1 </a></li>
        <li><a href="TestGeolocation3.html">Geolocation Test 2 </a></li>
    </ul>
